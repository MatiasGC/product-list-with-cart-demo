# Frontend Mentor - Product list with cart solution

This is my solution to the [Product list with cart challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d) by Frontend Mentor.  
It’s a simple product listing page with a fully functional cart — built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

## Overview

Users can:

- Add, remove, and update items in the cart
- Confirm their order and see a confirmation modal
- Reset the cart to start a new order
- Enjoy a responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
